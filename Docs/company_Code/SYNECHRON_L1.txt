Write a SQL query to find all employees in the `employees` table whose `salary` is greater than the average salary in their department. Assume that the table has `employee_id`, `department_id`, and `salary` columns 

employee = employee_id,department_id,salary


Select employee_id,department_id,salary from employees e WHERE SALARY > (SELECT e1.AVG(SALARY) from employees e1 group by e.department_id)

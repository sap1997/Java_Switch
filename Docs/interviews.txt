//CODE--

You are running a classroom and suspect that some of your students are passing around the answer to a multiple-choice question disguised as a random note.

Your task is to write a function that, given a list of words and a note, finds and returns the word in the list that is scrambled inside the note, if any exists. If none exist, it returns the result "-" as a string. There will be at most one matching word. The letters don't need to be in order or next to each other. The letters cannot be reused.

Example:  
words = ["baby", "referee", "cat", "dada", "dog", "bird", "ax", "baz"]
note1 = "ctay"
find(words, note1) => "cat"   (the letters do not have to be in order)  
  
note2 = "bcanihjsrrrferet"
find(words, note2) => "cat"   (the letters do not have to be together)  
  
note3 = "tbaykkjlga"
find(words, note3) => "-"     (the letters cannot be reused)  
  
note4 = "bbbblkkjbaby"
find(words, note4) => "baby"    
  
note5 = "dad"
find(words, note5) => "-"    
  
note6 = "breadmaking"
find(words, note6) => "bird"    

note7 = "dadaa"
find(words, note7) => "dada"
